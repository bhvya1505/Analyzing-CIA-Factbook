# Analyzing-CIA-Factbook-Data-Using-SQL
This project uses SQL with Jupyter Notebook to analyze data.

In this project, we'll work with data from the CIA World Factbook, a compendium of statistics about all of the countries on Earth. The Factbook contains demographic information like:
- population - The population as of 2015.
- population_growth - The annual population growth rate, as a percentage.
- area - The total land and water area.
The SQLite database, factbook.db, is available in the repository.

Refer the Jupyter Notebook file Basics.ipynb for the SQL codes and their explanation.
